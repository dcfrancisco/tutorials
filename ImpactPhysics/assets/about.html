 ImpactPhysics is an Android application ported and updated from a Java applet written 
 by John Henckel, June 1996, (c)  COPYRIGHT International Business Machines Corp. 1996
 <p> 
 The general purpose of this application is to create 2D ball objects that have attributes of 
 mass, size, color, coefficient of restitution and then place them in a medium with a degree of viscosity.
 The balls then interact with each other being attracted to each other by gravity and when they collide
 will rebound as a function of their coefficient of restitution.
 In addition the user can interact with the ball via the touch sensor and via the accelerometer.

was designed by <a href="http://creativenerds.co.uk">creative nerds</a>
<p>Inspiration and help for this came from many people on the internet such as this 
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/android/TiltBallWalkthrough.aspx">great tutorial</a> on basic android development and how to use the accelerometer.
<p>In addition there were many other generous people who posted small help and articles.  
I hope to repay some of that by posting this app on CodeProejct.
